# Fire-alarm-system


Hey there! it's Aryan Verma this side. 
Today I will be talking about my third project which I made for my college course. 
This project is based on Fire Alarm System. 
The tools used in this car are Arduino uno, IR flame sensor module, buzzer and some wire and jumpers. 
I will be adding some more cool features in this system and yeah you all are open to write some improvement's points on this car. 
This will boost me up and help me in making more projects like this.
